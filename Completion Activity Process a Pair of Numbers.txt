Design an algorithm that will prompt the user for the numerical value of two cards. The program will receive the two numbers and display their sum on the screen. If the calculated sum is 21, an asterisk is to be displayed beside the sum.

The program shall end when two zeros are entered.The program shall print a welcome message when it is first started and an goodbye message when it terminates.

Bonus:
Modify the algorithm to allow the user to enter the face cards as J,Q,K or A. If the user enters J, Q, or K then convert the entered value to 10. If the user enters A then count the value as 11 points.

Bonus Bonus:
Modify the algorithm to allow the user who receives the A to designate it either as 1 or 11.

Objective
Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing steps
What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
What variables are required?
Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

==================================

INPUTS

Card one value
Card two value
User designation of card value as 1 or 11 if A is entered

PROCESSING STEPS

Read card one value
Check if card one value is J,Q,K, or A
Set card one value to 10 if J,Q,K
Prompt user to designate value as 1 or 11 if 'A' entered

Read card two value
Check if card two value is J,Q,K, or A
Set card two value to 10 if J,Q,K
Prompt user to designate value as 1 or 11 if 'A' entered

Sum values of cards one and two

Check if sum = 21

OUTPUTS

Terminate program if sum is zero
Display sum with * if it equals 21, otherwise just display sum

PSEUDOCODE

Define variable for card one value (value1);
Define variable for card two value (value2);
Define variable for user designation of card value if it's "A" (user_value)
Define variable for the sum of the two card values (sum)

Prompt user for value1

CASE OF value1
	J: value1 = 10
	Q: value1 = 10
	K: value1 = 10
	A:
		Prompt user to designate value as 1 or 11
		Read in user_value
		value1 = user_value
ENDCASE

Prompt user for value2

CASE OF value2
	J: value2 = 10
	Q: value2 = 10
	K: value2 = 10
	A:
		Prompt user to designate value as 1 or 11
		Read in user_value
		value2 = user_value
ENDCASE

sum = value1 + value2;

IF(sum = 21)
	Print sum with an asterisk(*)
ELSEIF(sum = 0)
	Terminate program
ELSE
	Print sum
