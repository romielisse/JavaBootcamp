Design a program that will read a file of sales records and produce a sales report. Each record in the file contains a customer's number and name, a sales amount and a tax code. The tax code is to be applied to the sales amount to determine the sales tax due for that sale, as follows: 

Tax Code	Sales Tax
0	tax exempt
1	3%
2	5%

The report must print a heading, "Sales Report", followed by detail lines. Each detail line must list the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax and the total amount due.

=======================================

INPUTS

Customer record that includes a customer number, their name, a sales amount, and a tax code

PROCESSING STEPS

Read customer record
Determine sales tax based on customer's tax code

PSEUDOCODE

Define variable sales_tax_percent
Define variable sales_tax_due
Define variable total_amt_due

Print "Sales Report" heading
