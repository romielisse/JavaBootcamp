ALGORITHM

1. Get dimensions for a roof in feet.
2. Convert the roof dimensions to inches.
3. Multiply the resulting dimensions in inches by the number of inches of rainfall.
4. Divide that result by 231 to obtain a number in gallons, which will be the amount of water that runs off a roof during a rain storm.
