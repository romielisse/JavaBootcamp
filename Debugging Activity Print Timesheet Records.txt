Chanchal is the project manager for a small software development project. Each week she wants a report of the employees who have worked on her project full-time.

She has developed the pseudocode below but since she is the project manager and not the programmer it has an error in it. It's your job to fix the error to make her look good to the team. She plans to present the report at the standing meeting tomorrow morning. If you succeed she will look good and remember you when assigning new tasks.

You had told her that she would need a DOWHILE loop to control the repetition And an IF statement to select ‘FT’ records
