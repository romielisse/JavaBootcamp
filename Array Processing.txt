Create an algorithm to:
Find the sum of the elements of an array
Find the mean (average) of the elements of an array.

======================
INPUTS

Array of numbers

PROCESSESING STEPS

Determine array length
Loop through array
Sum up all numbers in array
Calculate average = sum/array length

OUTPUTS

Display sum and average to screen

======================
PSEUDOCODE

Define variable sum = 0;
Define variable mean = 0;

IF(array.length = 0)
	sum = 0;
	mean = 0;
	
ELSE
	WHILE(count <= array.length)
		sum+ = array(index);
		count++;
	ENDWHILE
	
	mean = sum/array.length;
	
Print sum and mean to screen.
