Design a solution algorithm that will read a file of student test results and produce a student test grades report. Each test record contains the student number, name and test score (out of 50). The program is to calculate for each student the test score as a percentage and to print the student’s number, name, test score (out of 50) and letter grade on the report.

The letter grade is determined as follows:
A = 90–100%
B = 80–89%
C = 70–79%
D = 60–69%
F = 0–59%

===============================

PSEUDOCODE

Define variable test_score_percent
Define variable letter_grade

Print "Student Test Results" heading

    DOWHILE morerecords exist
		
		Read test record
		
		test_score_percent = (test_score/50) * 100;
		
		IF (test_score_percent ≤ 100 && test_score_percent ≥ 90)
			letter_grade = 'A';
		ELSE IF (test_score_percent ≤ 89 && test_score_percent ≥ 80)
			letter_grade = 'B';
		ELSE IF (test_score_percent ≤ 79 && test_score_percent ≥ 70)
			letter_grade = 'C';
		ELSE IF (test_score_percent ≤ 69 && test_score_percent ≥ 60)
			letter_grade = 'D';
		ELSE IF  (test_score_percent ≤ 59 && test_score_percent ≥ 0)
			letter_grade = 'F';
		
        Print out Student Number, Student Name, Test Score out of 50, Letter Grade
